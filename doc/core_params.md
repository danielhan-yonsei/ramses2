The two namelist blocks `&CORE_PARAMS` and `&CORE_ACCRETION_PARAMS` control the core particle module. Cores are sink-like particles that form in dense gas clumps found by the PHEW clump finder, grow by flux accretion, can merge, and turn their mass into star particles. Cores are switched on at runtime with `core=.true.`; there is no compile-time flag.

Cores need a build with `NDIM=3` and `HYDRO=1`. On GPU, cores run on a single MPI rank, without MHD and with `NENER=0`, and core formation also needs `rho_type_core=4` and `core_saddle_threshold<=0`. The GPU does not write the core clump outputs yet: `output_core_clump` and `output_peak_core`, and with core formation `output_peak_grid`, `_part`, `_star`, `_sink` and `_tree`; support is planned. These combinations stop the code when the namelist is read. Core formation also needs `GRAV=1`: without it, `core_form` has no effect.
